# Dihybrid Cross Simulator (4×4) 🧬

A **beautiful and professional** dihybrid cross simulator built with Python + Tkinter GUI.  
Perfect for teaching, research, or quick calculations in Mendelian genetics.

### Features
- Full 4×4 Punnett square (16 combinations)  
- Color-coded phenotypes (AB → green, Ab → yellow, aB → pink, ab → white)  
- Automatic 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio display  
- Clean, modern interface – no external libraries needed  
- Works instantly on Windows/Mac/Linux

### How to run
1. Have Python 3 installed  
2. Double-click `app.py` or run `python app.py`

**Example**: enter `AaBb` × `AaBb` → see the classic 9:3:3:1 result in colors!
